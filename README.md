# CompChem-Extract-Charge-SpinDensity-from-Gaussian-log
1. Make the python scripts excutable:  
chmod +x extract_mulliken_charge_spin.py 

2. The usage of this python scripts is shown as below:  
extract_mulliken_charge_spin.py molecule_A.log

3. You can find the charges/spins information of molecule A from gaussian log file in newly generated file, named molecule_A.CS.
